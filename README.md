**Introduction -**


Delver is a online tool to help Dungeon Masters(Game runners), in the game tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons. Dungeons and Dragons often has a lot of information that needs to be kept track of and the easier it is found, the smoother and more enjoyable the game is. Delver is solution to the masses of books, pens and sheets you normally have to have as a dungeon master. Created in 1 week at General Assembly Web Immersive.

**Concept -**

The key features i wanted to include in this project was a searchable database of all the information needed in dungeons and dragons. I wanted to be able to save selections to add to the ease of finding different data. I also wanted to include helpful tools such as a character sheet database and a dice roller.

**Technologies used -**
 
* React
* Express.js
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* D&D API
* Javascript
* CSS
* Photoshop CC
* Mocha
* Chai

**What went well -**
In this project i wanted to forego using a heavy framework and work with React and Sass more directly to realise my design. I wanted all the information easily assessible in one location. It was great getting to grips with React and the React way of doing things. It was also a great experience connecting to and using an API. Integrating APIs into a project was a great, eye-opening experience, and made me even more excited for the world of technology.

**Challenges -**
I found i had to rewrite some sections of my code to better pass props throughout the apps and design with everything coming from a centralised source. This was a great learning moment and really helped solidify some of the ideas we have been taught about React.

**Future Features -**
In the future i would like to give the overall site more polish, and expand some of the features like the dice rolling. I also would like to explore some of the more interesting relationships between databases and the designs that could come out of that. For instance colour coding classes and spells. Also a more involved character sheet creation.

**Final thoughts -**
Armed with more knowledge from the course, i decided to revisit Dungeons and Dragons database idea, but now using a API i could incorporate all the information i was lacking in my previous project. React has been great and i will definitely be using it in the future.
